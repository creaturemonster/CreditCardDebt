# CreditCardDebt
Many years ago, when I was in high school I created a mortgage calculator that calculated credit card debt.

#Americans are increasingly building massive debts on their credit cards.   College students are especially susceptible  to  creating huge balances on their credit cards.  Read #the following article from the  Portland Press Herald on March 17, 2010 and answer the following questions.  http://www.pressherald.com/archive/credit-card-debt-on-rise-among-college-students_2008-04-07.html 
#How do credit card companies entice college students to use credit cards?

Credit Card companies travel to different colleges and lure students with free mugs, t-shirts, food, and mini sports toy. Furthermore, Credit Card companies also appeal to students by persuading them through the idea of free money and instant prizes. College students are also short on cash; therefore, a credit card solves their cash problem. 
According to the article what is the average credit card debt of college seniors?
Seniors pay double the debt of freshmen at $2623 . 
What do students do to develop this debt?
Since the price of textbook is high, students have little spending money left over for essentials and nonessentials. As a result, they use credit cards to pay for gas and groceries.

Credit Cards charge a monthly interest but only require minimum payments each month.   Read the following article that explains how credit cards charge interest and determine minimum payment. http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/debt/20050503b1.asp  
Letâ€™s assume some of the average credit card rates:  
Minimum Payment:  the greater of 2% of balance   or $15
Interest Rate: 18%.
Credit Card companies charge people a minimum payment. Within that minimum payment, 2% or $15 goes to paying down the interest. As a result the remaining money is used to pay down the principal. The principal payment is slow if you pay the minimum payment every month.

#How can we determine the  minimum payment and remaining balance of a $5000 balance after 1 month?
The minimum payment is $100. The minimum payment is $5000 *0.02, which equals $100. The interest is 0.18/12*5000, which is $75. Therefore, the amount of money paid to lower the principal is $25. After one month, you will have a debt of $4975. 

If we iterate this process until the balance is zero  we can determine the actual cost of that $5000 and how many months it takes to pay off the loan.
It would take 472 months to pay off the debt. 

#What can you do to keep your credit balances low?
The way to keep the credit balance low is pay more than your minimum payment because that will decrease the interest payment. However, the best way to pay the entire balance in one payment. It will avoid interest payment.
